# Color-palette

This project demonstrates a simple interactive web page where the background color of the page changes dynamically based on the button clicked by the user. 
The page is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each button is associated with a specific color, and when a user clicks on any of the buttons, the background color of the page immediately updates to match the color of the selected button.
This project showcases how to interact with the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript and update styles dynamically.
It's an easy-to-understand implementation of event handling and CSS manipulation, perfect for beginners learning web development.
